# CS1699 Deliverable 4: Impact of Blockchain

**ASSIGNED: 13 November 2018 ... DUE: 6 DECEMBER 2018 (NO LATE SUBMISSION)**

_Note: Assignments (printout and final git commit) are due at the beginning of class on the day listed._

For the final assignment of this course, you have several options:

1. Write a five page paper (double-spaced) on a specific impact of blockchain technology on the world (either current or possible) OR an in-depth examinination of specific blockchain or cryptocurrency project (other than Bitcoin), or aspect thereof.
2. Develop a blockchain-based project - e.g. developing an ERC-20 token, adding functionality or tests to an existing blockchain project, developing a game on Ethereum, etc.  If you do this, you should also turn in a (very short!) paper which lists your name, the GitHub repository or other link to your project, and a short description (one to a few paragraphs) explaining what your project is and, if necessary, explaining how to use it.

I recommend you discuss with me before starting on your project or paper if you are at all concerned that your project or paper topic might not be satisfactory.

## Paper Ideas

1. How is or will blockchain technology impact a particular industry?
2. What is the difference between privacy coins?  Which is best for preserving anonymity?
3. What are the kinds of scaling systems that exist (e.g. sharding, Tangle, bulletproofs, etc.) and how do they compare?
4. What will be the economic impacts of a truly "hard" currency like Bitcoin in the real world?
5. Do you have an idea for a proof-of-useful-work function?
6. What are the legal and/or ethical implications of blockchain and smart contracts?  For example - assume there is a bug in a smart contract and a hacker exploits it - if "code is law", did they break any laws or ethical considerations?  Note: for this, you may want to research the Ethereum / Ethereum Classic split.

These are just a few ideas.  Please feel free to come to me if you have a general idea and would like to help "flesh it out" into a full paper.

## Project Ideas

1. Develop a "YouCoin" using the ERC-20 template on Ethereum, or a similar token on another platform.
2. Develop a distributed application ("dapp") for Ethereum, EOS, or similar platform.
3. Perform a security analysis on a smart contract or aspect of a cryptocurrency.
4. Develop a system to visually show how blockchains are built, how miners work, how consensus works, etc.

These are just a few ideas.  Please feel free to come to me if you have a general idea and would like to help "flesh it out" into a full system.

## Grading

The grading of this project will, by necessity, be more subjective than previous projects.  This is due to the fact that students will be working on a wide variety of projects/papers and so it is impossible to develop a specific rubric.  However, there are aspects that I will consider that I recommend you take into account as you are working on your final project.

### Project Grading

Aspects that I will consider:

1. Was the project of a reasonable difficulty? (e.g., fixing a typo on a Bitcoin comment, while commendable, would not be considered sufficient for a final project)
2. Is the project done well?  That is, does it work correctly?
3. Did you properly explain (in comments or your summary) what the system does or is supposed to do?

### Paper Grading

Aspects that I will consider:

1. Proper syntax, spelling, punctuation, etc.
2. Did you choose a specific topic and thesis statement?
3. Do your arguments follow logically from axioms or evidence?
4. Have you done research on the topic?
5. Have you used the concepts learned in class to support your arguments?
5. Did you explain possible drawbacks or reasons that your thesis might be false?

Note: I will *not* (and *never will*) take points off based on your point of view.  If you would like to argue that Bitcoin is an environmental disaster, or the 21st century equivalent of the Dutch Tulip Bubble, or whatever, I would love to hear it!  All I ask is that you write a well-supported paper that coherently and cogently makes your argument.
